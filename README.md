- Negative Transformation
- Log Transformation
- Power-Law (gamma) Transformation
- Square Average Filter
- Median Filter

functions are created with c++.

## LAB2
1- Histogram equalization algorithm,

2- Sharpening with Laplacian functions on c++.

## LAB3
2-D Fourier and Inverse Fourier Transform algorithm on c++.

## LAB4
1- Sharpening on spatial domain with Laplacian and Sobel.

2- Same process but this time Laplacian on frequency domain.

## LAB5
- Thresholding with Sobel 
- Otsu thresholding 
- Local thresholding using moving averages 
 
on Python with OpenCV and numpy.
